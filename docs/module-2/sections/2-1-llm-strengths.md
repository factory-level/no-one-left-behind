# 2.1 The Major LLMs: Strengths & Use Cases

Welcome to the world of AI model selection! Think of this module as your field guide to the major AI models available today. Just like you wouldn't use a hammer for every job around the house, you shouldn't use the same AI model for every task at work.

In this section, you'll learn to match the right AI tool to the right job, potentially saving hours of frustration and getting dramatically better results.

## Understanding the LLM Landscape

Before diving into specific models, let's establish what we're comparing. Large Language Models (LLMs) are like having different specialists on your team - each with their own expertise, working style, and capabilities.

**Key factors that differentiate LLMs:**
- **Context window**: How much information they can "remember" and work with at once
- **Processing speed**: How quickly they respond
- **Reasoning capability**: How well they handle complex, multi-step thinking
- **Specialty strengths**: What types of tasks they excel at
- **Cost structure**: How much they charge for different types of work
