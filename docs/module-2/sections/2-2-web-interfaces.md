# 2.2 Product Ecosystem: Web Interfaces

## Introduction: Your Digital AI Workplace

Think of web interfaces as your primary AI workspaces - like having different specialized offices for different types of work. Just as you might use a conference room for meetings, a quiet office for focused analysis, and a collaborative space for team projects, each AI platform's web interface is designed for specific types of tasks.

In this section, we'll explore the three major AI web interfaces you'll use in your daily work, understand their unique features, and learn when to choose each one. By the end, you'll have a clear decision framework for selecting the right interface for any task.

### Quick Recap: The Models Behind the Interfaces

Before diving into interfaces, let's briefly recall what we learned about the underlying models in Section 2.1:

- **Claude**: Your analytical workhorse, excellent for reasoning and long documents
- **ChatGPT**: Fast and conversational, great for quick tasks and brainstorming
- **Gemini**: Your secret weapon for massive context and Google Workspace integration

Now let's see how these capabilities translate into their web interfaces.

## Claude.ai: Your Analytical Command Center

Claude.ai's web interface is designed for sustained, thoughtful work. Think of it as your analytical command center - a place where you can dive deep into complex problems and maintain context over extended work sessions.

### Core Features Deep Dive

#### Projects: Your Contextual Workspaces

**What Projects Are:**
Projects in Claude.ai are like having separate, specialized offices for different areas of your work. Each Project maintains its own context, uploaded documents, and conversation history.

**Why Projects Matter:**
- **Context Persistence**: Claude remembers your work style, company details, and project-specific information
- **Document Integration**: Upload background materials that Claude references throughout your work
- **Focused Conversations**: Keep different work areas separate and organized

**Setting Up Effective Projects:**

1. **One Project per Major Work Domain**
   - Example Projects:
     - "Monthly Financial Analysis"
     - "Team Performance Reviews"
     - "Stakeholder Communications"
     - "Compliance Documentation"

2. **Project Configuration Best Practices:**
   ```
   Project Name: Monthly Financial Analysis

   Custom Instructions:
   "You are my financial analysis assistant. Always:
   - Reference our Q3 budget document (uploaded)
   - Use our company's preferred formatting
   - Flag any unusual variances over 10%
   - Suggest actionable insights for leadership"

   Uploaded Documents:
   - Q3 Budget Template
   - Company Financial Guidelines
   - Historical Analysis Examples
   ```

**Business Use Case Example:**
Sarah, a marketing manager, creates a "Campaign Performance Analysis" Project. She uploads past campaign reports, brand guidelines, and performance benchmarks. Now when she asks Claude to analyze new campaign data, it automatically references her company's standards and suggests improvements based on historical context.

#### Artifacts: Living Documents That Evolve

**What Artifacts Are:**
Artifacts are interactive documents that Claude can create, edit, and refine based on your feedback. Think of them as collaborative documents where Claude is your co-author.

**Types of Artifacts:**
- **Text documents**: Reports, emails, policy documents
- **Code**: Scripts, configuration files, data analysis code
- **Structured data**: Tables, CSV files, JSON configurations
- **Web content**: HTML pages, markdown documents

**How to Work with Artifacts Effectively:**

1. **Start with a Clear Request:**
   ```
   "Create a weekly team status report template that includes:
   - Project progress updates
   - Risk indicators
   - Resource needs
   - Next week priorities"
   ```

2. **Iterate and Refine:**
   - Claude creates the initial artifact
   - You provide feedback: "Add a section for blockers"
   - Claude updates the artifact in real-time
   - Continue refining until perfect

3. **Export and Use:**
   - Copy content for use elsewhere
   - Download as files when needed
   - Reference in future conversations

**Business Application:**
Tom, an operations director, asks Claude to create a project risk assessment template. Claude builds an Artifact with risk categories, scoring matrices, and action plans. Tom refines it through conversation ("Add a section for mitigation costs"), and Claude updates the template in real-time. Tom then uses this refined template across multiple projects.
