Think of AI tools like a toolbox. General LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) are like a Swiss Army knife - versatile and useful for many tasks. Specialized AI products are like purpose-built tools: a hammer for nails, a screwdriver for screws. They excel at specific functions that general tools handle adequately but not optimally.

### Why Specialized Tools Matter

**General LLMs excel at:**
- Conversational interactions
- Content creation and editing
- General problem-solving
- Multi-purpose tasks

**Specialized tools excel at:**
- Domain-specific workflows
- Integration with existing systems
- Optimized user experiences for particular use cases
- Advanced features not available in general models
