# AI Tool Decision Tree Exercise

**Module 2 Exercise 2 | Duration: 2 hours | Assessment Requirements: Choose appropriate tools for work scenarios + Create personal decision tree**

## Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will:
- Practice choosing appropriate AI tools for diverse work scenarios
- Understand the decision-making process for tool selection
- Create a personalized decision tree for your specific work context
- Develop confidence in AI tool selection decisions
- Build a reusable framework for future tool choices

## Overview

This exercise has two main components: scenario-based practice where you select tools for different work situations, and creation of your own personalized decision tree. Think of this as building your "AI tool GPS" - a guide that helps you navigate to the right tool for any task.

**Important:** There are often multiple "right" answers. Focus on your reasoning process, not finding the "perfect" choice.

**Available Tools** (check what you have access to):
- [ ] Claude.ai (free/paid?)
- [ ] ChatGPT (free/paid?)
- [ ] Gemini (free/paid?)
- [ ] Perplexity (free/paid?)
- [ ] NotebookLM
- [ ] Other: ________________

### Step 2: Define Your Decision Criteria

Rank these factors in order of importance for YOUR work (1 = most important):

## Part 5: Advanced Scenarios (Optional Challenge)

If you have extra time or want additional practice, try these complex scenarios:

### Complex Scenario A: Crisis Communication
Your company faces a PR crisis. You need to: analyze social media sentiment, draft responses for different audiences, create a communication timeline, and monitor ongoing reaction. Multiple tools and human oversight required.

### Complex Scenario B: Market Analysis
Launching a product in a new market requires: competitor analysis, market sizing, pricing strategy, regulatory research, and customer persona development based on limited data.

### Complex Scenario C: Process Optimization

**Pitfall:** Overcomplicating your decision tree
**Solution:** Start simple, add complexity only when needed

**Pitfall:** Not considering practical constraints
**Solution:** Factor in your actual access, budget, and time constraints

**Pitfall:** Creating a decision tree you won't actually use
**Solution:** Make it practical and accessible for your real work environment

**Pitfall:** Never updating your decision tree
**Solution:** Plan regular reviews and updates as tools evolve

## Next Steps

**Immediate (this week):**
- Use your decision tree for 2-3 real work tasks
- Note what works well and what feels awkward
- Refine your tree based on initial experience

**Short-term (next month):**
- Share your approach with colleagues and get feedback
- Experiment with tools you haven't used much
- Track time savings and quality improvements

**Long-term (ongoing):**
- Regularly update your decision tree as tools evolve
- Help teammates develop their own decision frameworks
- Contribute to team knowledge about AI tool selection

**Remember:** The best decision tree is one that gets better with use. Start with your current version and improve it through real-world application. Your goal is not perfection but consistent, thoughtful tool selection that improves your work quality and efficiency.
