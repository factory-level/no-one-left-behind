## What Are Projects?

Projects are persistent, contextual workspaces in Claude that allow you to:
- Maintain consistent context across conversations
- Upload background documents
- Define custom instructions
- Organize work by domain or purpose

## Project Creation Strategy

### Domain-Driven Organization

1. **Professional Domain Projects**
   - Data Analysis Project
   - Stakeholder Communication Hub
   - Research and Documentation
   - Team Management Assistant

2. **Personal Knowledge Management**
   - Learning Tracker
   - Personal Development
   - Creative Writing
   - Travel Planning

## Advanced Project Configuration

### Custom Instructions
- Defining project-specific persona
- Setting communication style
- Establishing core guidelines
- Specifying output preferences

### Document Integration
- Uploading relevant background materials
- Creating a knowledge base
- Enabling semantic search across documents

## Practical Lab: Create Strategic Projects

### Exercise 1: Professional Project Setup
- Create a "Monthly Reporting" project
- Upload typical data sources
- Define custom instructions for consistent report generation

### Exercise 2: Knowledge Management
- Create a personal learning project
- Add learning resources
- Use project for summarization and note-taking

## Best Practices

1. Keep projects focused
2. Regularly update background documents
3. Review and refine custom instructions
4. Use projects for complex, recurring tasks

## Limitations and Considerations
- Document size limits
- Periodic context refreshing needed
- Privacy and data management

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Project not remembering context?
- Documents not searchable?
- Inconsistent outputs?
