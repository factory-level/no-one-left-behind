# Module 6: OpenAI AgentKit
## Low-code agent building for rapid prototyping

Welcome to Module 6, where you'll learn to build sophisticated AI agents using OpenAI's AgentKit platform. This module bridges the gap between understanding agents (Module 5) and building advanced automation systems (Modules 7-8).

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

✅ **Build Working AI Agents** - Create agents that autonomously handle business processes
✅ **Leverage Pre-built Templates** - Accelerate development using OpenAI's agent library
✅ **Design Multi-Agent Systems** - Orchestrate teams of specialized agents working together
✅ **Integrate with Business Systems** - Connect agents to your existing tools and workflows
✅ **Measure Real Business Impact** - Calculate ROI and optimize agent performance
