- **Starter Prompt**: A basic version to improve
- **Success Criteria**: How to know you've succeeded
- **Sample Solution**: One possible approach (yours might be different!)

## Exercise 1: The Email Rescue Mission

### Scenario
You're helping a small business owner write professional emails. They tend to be too casual or too aggressive, and need help finding the right tone.

### Your Mission
Transform this email into something professional but warm:

**Original email:**
> "hey sarah, ur late on the payment again. this is the 3rd time this month. we need the money ASAP or we'll have to cut off service. not trying to be mean but business is business. let me know whats up."

### Starter Prompt (Improve This!)
> "Make this email more professional"

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Maintains the core message (payment is overdue)
- ✅ Professional but not cold or threatening
- ✅ Preserves relationship while addressing issue
- ✅ Includes specific next steps

### Practice Space
Take 5 minutes to improve the starter prompt using techniques from Modules 1.2-1.3. Consider:
- What role should AI play?
- What specific guidance about tone?
- What examples might help?
- How can you ensure the right balance?

### Sample Solution
```
You are a professional business communication consultant specializing in maintaining positive relationships while addressing difficult topics.

Transform this informal email into a professional but warm message:

[Original email text here]

Requirements:
- Maintain a respectful, understanding tone
- Clearly communicate the payment issue and urgency
- Preserve the business relationship
- Include specific next steps for resolution
- Professional language while avoiding corporate coldness

Format: Standard business email with appropriate greeting, body paragraphs, and closing.

Consider that this is the third occurrence, so acknowledgment of the pattern is needed, but approach it collaboratively rather than accusingly.
```

**Expected AI output style:**
> "Dear Sarah,
>
> I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding your account balance, which shows a payment that was due [date]. I notice this is the third occurrence this month, and I wanted to connect directly to understand if there are any challenges we can help address.
>
> While I want to support your business in every way possible, the outstanding balance is affecting our cash flow and we'll need to resolve this within the next 48 hours to avoid any service interruptions.
>
> Could we schedule a brief call to discuss your payment schedule and see if we can establish a arrangement that works for both of us? I'm confident we can find a solution that keeps our partnership strong.
>
> Please let me know your availability for a conversation.
>
> Best regards,
> [Name]"

## Lab Conclusion: Building Your Prompting Toolkit

### Reflection Questions
After completing these exercises, consider:

1. **Which techniques felt most natural?** Start with these in your real work
2. **Where did you struggle most?** These are areas for continued practice
3. **What patterns emerged in your successful prompts?** Note these for future use
4. **How can you adapt these examples to your industry/role?**

### Your Personal Prompting Checklist
Based on this lab, create your own checklist:

**Before writing any prompt, I will:**
- [ ] Define the role/expertise I need from AI
- [ ] Specify my audience and context
- [ ] Include examples when helpful
- [ ] Ask for reasoning, not just answers
- [ ] Set clear success criteria

**For complex tasks, I will:**
- [ ] Break the task into smaller parts
- [ ] Use chain of thought reasoning
- [ ] Consider multiple perspectives
- [ ] Ask for specific implementation steps
- [ ] Plan to iterate and improve

### Next Steps in Your Prompting Journey

**Immediate actions:**
1. Choose one exercise that relates to your work and try it with a real scenario
2. Save the prompt templates that worked best for you
3. Practice one advanced technique daily for the next week

**Ongoing development:**
- Keep a "prompt journal" of what works and what doesn't
- Share successful prompts with colleagues
- Experiment with combining different techniques
- Stay curious and keep iterating

### Key Takeaways from the Lab

1. **Practice builds intuition** - The more you prompt, the more natural it becomes
2. **Context is everything** - Generic prompts get generic responses
3. **Iteration is normal** - Don't expect perfect prompts on the first try
4. **Structure beats improvisation** - Frameworks like CLEAR consistently work better
5. **Specificity wins** - Detailed prompts get better, more useful responses

## Troubleshooting Common Lab Challenges

### "My prompts are too long"
- Start with core elements: role, task, context
- Add details only when the basic version doesn't work
- Use bullet points and clear structure

### "AI responses are still generic"
- Add more specific context about your situation
- Include constraints and requirements
- Ask for examples rather than general principles

### "I don't know if my prompt is good"
- Test it! Run the prompt and evaluate the response
- Ask: "Could I actually use this output?"
- Compare responses from different prompt versions

### "Advanced techniques feel awkward"
- Start with one technique at a time
- Master basic structure first
- Practice with low-stakes scenarios
