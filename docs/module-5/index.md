## From Tool-Using AI to Autonomous Workers

### Module Overview
In this module, you'll transition from understanding AI tools to comprehending AI agents as autonomous, goal-directed systems. We'll explore how AI can move beyond simple tool usage to becoming proactive problem-solvers in business and knowledge work environments.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the fundamental architecture of AI agents
- Explore multi-agent system dynamics
- Design basic agent workflows
- Analyze real-world agent application scenarios
- Prepare for advanced agent development in Module 6

### Key Sections
1. What Are AI Agents?
2. Agent Architecture Fundamentals
3. Multi-Agent Systems: The Power of Specialization
4. Agent Design Principles
5. Planning Your First Agent System

### Module Preparation
- Ensure Claude Desktop is installed
- Review previous modules on AI tools and interfaces
- Prepare for hands-on design challenges

**Note**: This module bridges theoretical understanding with practical implementation, setting the stage for advanced agent orchestration in subsequent modules.
