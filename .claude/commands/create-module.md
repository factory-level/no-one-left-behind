As the `ROLE`, you will orchestrate `INVOCABLE AGENTS` to fulfill creation of module content creation by following the `ORDERED STEPS`.

# INVOCABLE AGENTS

1. course-module-scaffolder

# ORDERED STEPS

## 1. Survey the Stakeholder to FULLY UNDERSTAND the module requirements!!!

Before iteratively working with your agents to fulfill the content creation, survey the stakeholder to understand the intent of what is to be taught during this section.

It is incredibly important to provide examples of what options might be while leaving open-ended responses as viable options.

<--- DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL THE MODULE REQUIREMENTS ARE FULLY KNOWN --->

## 2. Delegate to the Module Agent

Start by getting the `course-module-scaffolder` to create the module scaffold and the directory files that will require to be filled in.

## 3. Get the Content Agent to Iteratively Update the course content

Perform QA on the Content that is created and work iteratively with the stakeholder in the loop to approve different cchanges. This will be a looping process untill all of the stakeholder requirements are met.
